Mafalda is a comic strip written and drawn by Argentine cartoonist Joaqu√≠n Salvador Lavado,
better known by his pen name Quino. The strip features a 6-year-old girl named Mafalda,
who reflects the Argentinian middle class and progressive youth, which is concerned about
humanity and world peace and rebels against the world bequeathed by their elders.
